HeatedPlate
===========

A collection of sequential and parallel steady state heat equation solvers.

Implement Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel and Red Black Gauss-Seidel solvers for the Laplace equation.

For each solver a sequential version and one or more OpenMP version are provided.

The initial OpenMP Jacobi implementation is derived from the following work http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/c_src/heated_plate_openmp/heated_plate_openmp.html by John Burkardt.
